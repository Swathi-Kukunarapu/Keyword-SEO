**Project Overview**

The Google Keyword Analyzer is a web application that allows users to input a search query and a keyword. Upon hitting the search button, the application connects to the Google search engine, retrieves the top 10 articles related to the query, and analyzes the presence of the specified keyword in each article. The project then assigns a color code to each article based on the frequency of the keyword.

**Workflow**

**1. User Input**
   - Users provide two inputs:
     - Content to Search: The topic or content they want to search on Google.
     - Keyword: The specific keyword they want to analyze within the search results.
       
**2. Backend Processing**

•	The backend code connects to the Google search engine and fetches the top 10 articles related to the given content.
•	For each article, it calculates the frequency of the specified keyword and computes the average keyword count across all articles.
•	Based on the keyword count, it assigns a color code to each article:
Red: Count between 0 and average/2
Yellow: Count between average/2 and average
Green: Count greater than average

**3. User Interface (UI) Display**
   - The UI displays a set of color-coded boxes, each representing an article.
   - Each box contains:
     - Title: The title of the article.
     - Link: The link to the article.
     - Meta Description: A brief description of the article.
     - Keyword Count: The number of times the keyword appears in the article.
   - The color of the box corresponds to the assigned color code based on keyword count.
     
Each box corresponds to an article and includes essential information such as the title, link, meta description, and the count of the specified keyword. This visual representation allows users to quickly assess the relevance and prominence of their chosen keyword in the top search results.
The uniqueness of the "Google Keyword Analyzer" lies in its ability to delve deeper into these articles, meticulously calculating the frequency of the specified keyword within each. Through this analysis, the project derives an average keyword count across all articles, paving the way for a dynamic color-coding system.
 
 **Use of the Project:**
The Google Keyword Analyzer project serves several purposes:

**1. SEO Analysis:** Users can assess the relevance of a keyword in the top search results for a given content, helping them understand the SEO impact of their chosen keyword.

**2. Content Optimization:** Content creators can use the tool to analyze how well their target keyword is represented in top articles, guiding them in optimizing their own content.

**3. Competitor Analysis:** Businesses and marketers can gain insights into how often specific keywords appear in articles related to their industry or niche, aiding in competitor analysis.

**4. Data Visualization:** The color-coded display provides a quick and visually intuitive way for users to identify the prominence of their chosen keyword in the search results.
